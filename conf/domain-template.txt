Resource Record Type

rr.  NS, CNAME, MX, Wilcard MX..:

   If you are requesting a NS record
          Fill f1...fX and i1...iX respectively with the fully
          qualified domain names and (only if necessary) the IP addresses
          for your domain servers; put the primary at the top of the
          list. You don't need to fill all lines. IP addresses are only
          needed when the domain names for the servers are within the
          requested domain.
          
   If you are requesting a MX (or wildcard-MX) record
          Fill f1..fX. The names you supply must point to an
          address (A type) record. The lowest precedence MX should be
          listed first.
          
   If you are requesting a CNAME record
          Only fill f1. It must exist and must not point to a CNAME
          record.

The party requesting registration of this name certifies that, to her/his
knowledge, the use of this name does not violate trademark or other statutes.

Registering a domain name does not confer any legal rights to that name and
any disputes between parties over the rights to use a particular name are to
be settled between the contending parties using normal legal methods.

                             EU.ORG GENERAL POLICY
                                       
   The following recursively applies to _all_ subdomains of EU.org.
   
   There are additional rules for direct subdomains.
   
Commercial sites

   Though the service is mostly geared towards non-profit and
   not-for-profit organizations and individuals, small commercial sites
   are accepted, but they are _VERY STRONGLY_ asked to do so only as a
   very last resort, unless of course they support EU.org goals.
   
Non-European sites

   Since Europe is not the only place where national NIC policies are a
   problem, non-european sites are welcome.
   
Administrative authorizations

   It is advised that owners of subdomains obtain necessary
   administrative authorizations from the site(s) hosting their
   nameservers or machines in the domain.
   
Subdomains

   Subdomain managers willing to provide registration to third parties in
   their domain have an obligation to:
   
   Provide registration for free or for a minimal fee
          The registration fee, if any, _MUST_ be minimal and must only
          cover costs in _DIRECT RELATION_ with the registration and
          management of the zone file(s) and server(s). Using
          registration fees to fund any of the following is explicitly
          excluded :
          
          + software development work (even DNS-related);
          + wages;
          + paperwork.
            
   Registration in a given subdomain can be reserved to the members of an
          organization with a subscription fee, but the subdomain
          registration should not be the primary service provided by the
          organization to its paying members.
          
   Be equitable to all groups in the domain that request domain names
          
Compliance to Internet standards

   Subdomain owners must comply with Internet standards (RFCs). This
   includes, but is not limited to:
     * name of subdomains
     * e-mail software
     * nameserver software
       
Trademarks

   InterNIC rules regarding trademarks apply:
   
     Registering a domain name does not confer any legal rights to that
     name and any disputes between parties over the rights to use a
     particular name are to be settled between the contending parties
     using normal legal methods (See RFC 1591).
     
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   

                               POLICY FOR EU.ORG
                                       
   The following only applies to domains registered _directly within_
   EU.org.
   
   The general policy also applies.
   
Non-proliferation

   The domain manager reserves the right to refuse any domain creation
   directly in EU.org if it is estimated that registration in an existing
   subdomain of EU.org (country delegation, for example) would be
   acceptable.
   
   The goal is to avoid the creation of a flat and unmanageable
   namespace.
   
Type of records

   To minimize administration, only domain delegation (_NS_ records) is
   provided.
   
   If you want other types of resource records, you will have to request
   a domain delegation for the desired zone and manage the new zone
   yourself.
   
   This implies that you need access to a machine running a name server.
   Sites willing to provide this service for third parties can contact
   hostmaster@EU.org.
   
Subdomain names

   Only subdomains of 4 characters or more will be registered
   automatically.
   
   3 character names are normally reserved for internal use and future
   extensions, but can be allocated on a case-by-case basis preferably to
   non-profit associations, european organizations, and so on.
   
   2 character names are reserved to ISO country codes (country
   delegations) and internal use.
   
   Write to hostmaster@EU.org if you have good reasons to ask for such a
   domain (for example if you want to get a delegation for a country
   domain).
     _________________________________________________________________
   

                           OPEN DOMAINS AND POLICIES
                                       
   In addition to _EU.org_ itself, the following subdomains are already
   reserved and open to registration.
   
   The idea is to avoid creating a flat and unmanageable namespace in
   EU.org. Registration directly in EU.org is possible, but it is advised
   that you register in one of the following subdomains instead.
   
   The policies for these domains are the same as the general policy for
   EU.org, with the addition that _MX_, _wildcard MX_ and _CNAME_ records
   are allowed.
   
   If the country (or other, like NET.eu.org for example) of your dreams
   is not in the list below, don't hesitate to write to hostmaster@EU.org
   to request that it is created and open to registration. The reason it
   is not present is probably that no one requested it yet.
   
   International domains
          
        EDU.eu.org
                Educational sites
                
        NET.eu.org
                Network-related
                
        eu.org
                Organizations
                
   There is no ORG.eu.org for organizations; EU.org itself is supposed to
          serve that purpose.
          
   EEC countries already delegated:
          
          + FR.eu.org
          + NL.eu.org
          + Other countries will be opened on request.
            
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   

                             RESOURCE RECORD TYPES
                                       
   When you register your domain, you can ask for one of the following
   record types. They are listed in order of increasing complexity and
   needed resources.
   
   CNAME
          A _CNAME_ is an alias to a name of your choice that you can
          change any time you want. It can be used, for example, to
          obtain a provider-independent address for dialup users. It has
          the drawback of being "hidden", for example your mail addresses
          will be rewritten with the "real" name, not the alias you
          requested in EU.org. On the other hand, it needs no
          configuration change except here in EU.org.
          
          For example, suppose your mail address is currently
          _you@cheapnet.fr_ and you'd like it to be _you@mynet.fr.eu.org_
          (notice that the username, left of @, will not change). You
          only need to fill a request for domain _mynet.fr.eu.org_, type
          _CNAME_, and put _cheapnet.fr_ as Name1.
          
   MX
          This is a "mail exchanger" record that is used to direct mail
          to a particular machine. To use this, you need the destination
          machine to be configured to recognize your new address. This
          obviously implies that the administrator of the target machine
          must agree.
          
   Wildcard MX
          Exactly the same as the above, except it also gets mail for
          subdomains. The destination machine should be able to deal with
          this, of course.
          
   NS
          Full domain delegation, the method that gives you the most
          control over your domain. To use this, you need at least two
          permanently connected machines running a nameserver configured
          with your domain.
          
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   

                          HOW TO REGISTER YOUR DOMAIN
                                       
   Registering means you agree to comply with the rules explained in the
   policies relevant for the domain you register in.
   
    1. Read the general policy;
    2. Choose a record type suited to your needs and your possibilities;
    3. Choose an open domain to register in, according to the record type
       you want.
       _Try to avoid registration directly under EU.org_;
    4. If you really, really want to register directly in EU.org, check
       the policy for direct subdomains; there are intentionally more
       constraints;
    5. If you want a full domain delegation, configure your
       nameserver(s);
    6. Fill and submit the registration form.
       The form (and your nameserver configuration, if it applies) will
       be checked for errors and you will immediately be presented with
       the results;
    7. Iterate, correcting errors until your request is accepted;
    8. Wait for an e-mail reply indicating that your request has been
       validated. This step requires human intervention and can take a
       few days.
