			AR41 0.9 beta

AR41 currently runs on the following software configuration and
needs the following software packages:

		Perl 4
		AR41 probably won't work on Perl 5 without some work

		Apache httpd 1.1 or the latest 1.2beta
		Any Apache above 1.0 should be ok

		sendmail
		Any version; at last 8.x recommended

		named
		Any version of BIND will probably do; 4.9.5 P1 recommended

		dig
		Any version will probably do; 2.1 or above recommended.
		It's included in the BIND distribution.

In this distribution you'll find the following directories:

	./html			sample HTML
	./zones			sample zones (EU.ORG)
	./bin			scripts
	./cgi-bin		CGI scripts
	./conf			config files

The request flow in AR41 is organized in the following way:


(1) the user sends a request

	   Web (httpd)			Mail (sendmail)
		|				|
	cgi-bin/nph-dnsreq		bin/receive-mail
		|				|
		---------------------------------
				|
			 check-request -> request stored to val/*


(2) the administrator accesses requests in val/* through the CGI script
	"val".
	
			      httpd
				|
			   cgi-bin/val

(3) the administrator validates a request:

			      httpd
				|
			   cgi-bin/val
				|
			bin/access-zone -> updates the zone file
