			AR41 0.10 beta

AR41 currently runs on the following software configuration and
needs the following software packages:

		Perl 4
		AR41 probably won't work on Perl 5 without some work

		Apache httpd 1.1 or 1.2
		Any Apache above 1.0 should be ok

		sendmail
		Any version; at least 8.x recommended
		Use mailer option "9" (if available) to decode
		quoted-printable garbage.

		named
		Any version of BIND will probably do;
		Most recent versions (currently 4.9.6 or 8.1.1) recommended

		dig
		Any version will probably do; 2.1 or above recommended.
		It's included in the BIND distribution.

In this distribution you'll find the following directories:

	./html			sample HTML
	./zones			sample zones (EU.ORG)
	./bin			scripts
	./cgi-bin		CGI scripts
	./conf			config files
	./lib			Perl library files

The request flow in AR41 is organized in the following way:


(1) the user sends a request

	   Web (httpd)			Mail (sendmail)
		|				|
	cgi-bin/nph-dnsreq		bin/receive-mail
		|				|
		---------------------------------
				|
			 check-request -> request stored in val/*,
						state "WaitAck".
				       -> confirmation request sent
					  by mail to user.

(2) the user acknowledges the request by mail

			Mail (sendmail)
				|
			bin/receive-mail -> request updated to state = "Open".
					 -> Mail reply to the user

(3) the administrator accesses requests in val/* through the CGI script
	"val".
	
			      httpd
				|
			   cgi-bin/val

(4) the administrator validates a request:

			      httpd
				|
			   cgi-bin/val -> request file deleted
				       -> bin/access-zone (zone file updated)
				       -> Mail to the user (confirmation)
				       -> Mail to the Whois db manager

Once in a while the "real" zones need to be updated:

(5) the administrator updates the master zones (needs access to a shell)

	# cd /usr/local/dns-manager/zones
	# ../bin/soa UK.EU.ORG FR.EU.ORG

(6) the nameserver is reloaded

	# ndc reload
