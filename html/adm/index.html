<H1>How to validate a domain request</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Choose a request in the <A HREF="cgi-bin/val.cgi">request list</A>;
<LI>Prioritary requests are flagged in green, duplicates are flagged in red;
<LI>Check that it seems to comply with the <A HREF="../policy.html">policy</A>
  of EU.org and the policy of the relevant subdomain;
<LI>Choose an action on this request:
  <DL>
  <DT>Accept
  <DD>
  <UL>
    <LI>Check that the WHOIS info is correct and well formatted.
      <OL>
      <LI><TT>address:</TT> should be a correctly formatted address
      <LI><TT>person:</TT> should be a correctly formatted name
	(<STRONG>John Smith</STRONG> and not <STRONG>Smith John</STRONG>
	nor <STRONG>John SMITH</STRONG>)
      <LI><TT>nic-hdl:</TT> (if present) should exist (check the InterNIC
	or RIPE Whois database) and should point to the right person.
	<P>
	Despite warnings everywhere, some people persist in inventing
	a NIC handle for themselves. Don't hesitate to edit these out
	by replacing <TT>admin-c:</TT> and <TT>tech-c:</TT> by the
	full name as it appears in the <TT>person:</TT> line, and
	delete the <TT>nic-hdl:</TT> line.
      </OL>
      If you detect an error, correct it and press
      the <STRONG>Submit</STRONG> button.
    <LI>Modifications to the EU.org WHOIS base are automatically handled
	by the validation script.
     <STRONG>There should be a WHOIS entry for every domain!</STRONG>
    <LI>Zone modifications are automatically validated.
    </UL>

    it will be included in the rejection mail sent to the requester.
