PRELIMINARY. Many bits are missing.

Autoreg can be installed with ./setup.py install, or from a pre-wrapped
package (Python egg, etc).

It currently requires:
	- Python 2.7; untested with Python 3.*.
	- Django 1.8.* or 1.9.*
	- WSGI (for Django)
	- Postgres 9.6
	- Bind 9.10
	- Postfix 3.2 (or another mail-transfer agent if you convert
          handles.cf)

Required Python modules are listed in setup.py.

1) Install the Python package, then the additional shell scripts in bin/

2) Create userids for 'autoreg' and 'whois'

3) Create a Postgres database, run postgres/eu.org.schema on it

4) Configure a web server with WSGI.

   See configurations (with Apache sample) in sample-files/

5) The DNS zone files are generated in /etc/namedb/autoreg/

6) create a superuser account with necessary permissions
   to access the request list.

7) See cron jobs samples in sample-files/crontab.
